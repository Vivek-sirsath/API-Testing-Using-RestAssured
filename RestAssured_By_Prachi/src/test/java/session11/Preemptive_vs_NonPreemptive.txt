OAuth 2.0 Protocol -
------------------
- Its the protocol which is followed while authenticating any third party application.
- e.g.
       xyz.com asks us to login to their web site. But we have a Microsoft or GitHub accounts.
       Then xyz.com prompts us to login with Microsoft or GitHub.
       Then we choose one of the option. 
       Then the authentication happens through OAuth2.0 protocol. Because xyz.com will be third party application for us.
